## Vision
### Values
User satisfaction is our main concern. To achieve this we will provide a service to our users so that they will never be lost no matter the situation. Building a responsive app is also one of our main pillars because without this value none of the others can exist. Finally our last underlying value is to use the newest cutting edge technology to provide a better navigation service.
### Mission
Our mission is to connect people through a pinpoint GPS so that any person is able to locate themselves inside an event or a conference. By promoting interactivity between attendees and speakers, our main objective is to provide a better overall experience to all participants of the conference. 
### Motto
_Guiding you to success_
## Elevator Pitch
"Hey! So, after this talk there is going to be a workshop in room 212, don't forget to check it out!". But the problem is that the attendees aren't FEUP students, and they don't have directions to the workshop. Our app fixes that.

Solution: We aim to build an internal positioning system to connect people with events and other people, giving them directions to their desired destinations.

Resources: We'll need at least 3 Raspberry Pi or 3 Bluetooth low energy beacons to build our prototype.

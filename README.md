## Elevator Pitch
"Hey! So, after this talk there is going to be a workshop on room 212, don't forget to check it out!". But the problem is that the attendees aren't **FEUP** students, and they don't have directions to the workshop. Our app fixes that.

Solution: We aim to build an internal positioning system to connect people with events and other people, giving them directions to their desired destinations.

Resources: We'll need at least 3 Raspberry Pi or 3 Bluetooth low energy beacons to build our first prototype.
